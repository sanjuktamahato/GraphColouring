# GraphColouring
Graph coloring is the assignment of colors to vertices of a graph so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Itâ€™s used to solve problems like scheduling, register allocation, and map coloring. The goal is to minimize the number of colors used while satisfying constraints.
